<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>When you are deploying your application on AWS, you might want to use an
AutoScaling Group to launch your EC2 instances. It works relatively well, has
a lot of feature such as auto healing, scalability according to metrics, load
balancer integration, etc. Everything seems great with AutoScaling Group,
except when you want to have a DNS record pointing on your instances.
With a single EC2, it is possible to automatically add a Route53 record
pointing to the instance with CloudFormation. But if you use an AutoScaling
Group, AWS does not provide an automatic method to add each instance IP to a
Route53 record. One well known workaround is to deploy an Elastic Load
Balancer in front of the ASG and then add a record pointing to the ELB.
It works well in most of the cases but sometimes you don&rsquo;t really need or you
want to avoid having a load balancer. For instance if you deploy a Kafka
cluster on an ASG, you don&rsquo;t want a load balancer because Kafka is designed to
distribute traffic between brokers itself. In this blog post I will present a
solution to solve this problem, using a Lambda function.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>The AutoScaling Group will be configured to send a notification to a SNS topic
when an instance is created or terminated. A Lambda function will be triggered
by those notifications and will update the Route53 record accordingly. This
Lambda function will query the Amazon API to get the IP of the instances in the
AutoScaling Group then it will update the Route53 record. It will be trigger
by an instance creation or an instance termination.</p>

<h3 id="route53-manager-lambda-function">Route53 manager Lambda function</h3>

<p>The Lambda function is written in Python 3. It will receive the AutoScaling
notification as a parameter, in a JSON string. The function will use Boto3
to get the AutoScaling Group instance lists and their IPs. Then it will add
the primary IP list to the Route53 record with Boto3. If an instance is joining
or leaving the ASG, the list will be updated IP, no parsing is done on the
Lambda. If the IP list is empty, the record wil be removed from Route53.</p>

<h3 id="cloudformation">Cloudformation</h3>

<p>In the following gist, you can find a CloudFormation template that deploy the
route53-manager lambda function, the SNS topic and a demo AutoScaling group to
test it.</p>

<h2 id="alternative">Alternative</h2>

<p>An alternative design can be to configure a CloudWatch Event to trigger the
Lambda if CloudTrail is receiving a CreateInstance API call. Another
alternative solution that works without Lambda or SNS topic or CloudWatch Event
can be to put the Lambda code as a script inside each instances and call it in
the user-data script when the instance is booting. But this solution does
not work if we loose an instance unexpectedly since it is the instance that
update the Route53 record. In this case your record will be in an inconsistent
state until a new instance is launched. In the case of a controlled termination,
we can use a lifecycle hook to run the script the but it increases the solution
complexity.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The solution I proposed to the Route53 record pointing to the instances an
AutoScaling Group is a Lambda function that listen to the AutoScaling Group
notifications sent to an SNS topic and add or removed IP from the record if the
instance is created or terminated. It seems a bit hacky, but at the end it is
really gluing AWS services together but since Amazon does not provide built-in
solution, in the end this is a working solution for this problem. I have been
running this kind of Lamdba every time I encounter this issue for years now and
it never let me down. If you have a better solution for this, don&rsquo;t hesitate
to hit me up !</p>
