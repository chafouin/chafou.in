<p>Hi, I am Vincent but everyone call me Chafouin. I am a software engineer for
F-Secure, a finnish cybersecurity company. Welcome to my sweet blog. This blog
is not about me: I won&rsquo;t post thoughts or personnal stories, this blog is
dedicated to computer science. I will write articles about system
administration, cloud architecture, automation and a lot of different topics,
all relate to DevOps practices. As I said I am not here to talk about me but
to share what I learn and think it can be interested to share.</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy system administration, scripting and testing
new open-source tools, understand how they work and how they can be used.
But I had always keep everything for myself: if it works or not, if I found a
better way to do it, if I was completely mistaken. That was selfish, I agree.
Every time I wanted to understand something or if I was stuck or I needed some
hints, I checked first if someone on his blog, on Reddit or StackExchange had
already faced the same issue. Most of the time I find an answer to my question
on the Internet. But sometime I stumble upon an issue without getting a clear
solution from the Internet and I have to build my own. What if someone have
the same issue, I find a way to make it work and I don&rsquo;t share it ? He will
surely waste his time trying to figure this out. That&rsquo;s what I realize, even
my small experience can be useful to someone eventually. This is the very
purpose of this blog: trying to participate and help after years of lurking. I
hope you will enjoy it and learn something new after reading. I will be very
happy if somehow I helped someone with it. But remember, I am just a human and
I still learn new things everyday, what I say is not the one and only truth and
I don&rsquo;t pretend to be an absolute reference. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to contact me if
you have questions, see some mistakes or think I am a total joke and I should
stop everything IT related and start to sell roasted chestnuts on the street.</p>

<p>Kisses.</p>
