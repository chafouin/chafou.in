      <description>AWS AutoScaling Group lifecycle management AutoScaling Service Amazon Web Services AutoScaling is a service that automatically adjust the capacity of a group of EC2 instancesd.

      <description>Dynamic DNS within an AutoScaling Group Problem When you are deploying your application on AWS, you might want to use an AutoScaling Group to launch your EC2 instances. It works relatively well, has a lot of feature such as auto healing, scalability according to metrics, load balancer integration, etc. Everything seems great with AutoScaling Group, except when you want to have a DNS record pointing on your instances. With a single EC2, it is possible to automatically add a Route53 record pointing to the instance with CloudFormation.</description>

      <title>Monitoring: from Sensu to Elastic Stack</title>
      <link>https://chafou.in/archives/sensu-elk/</link>

      <description>Few months ago, I wrote an article for the company I work for about Sensu and how to collect metrics and forward them into ElasticSearch. This is only a PoC but I think it can be useful, at least to understand how to setup Sensu and Logstash and how Sensu checks and handlers work.
Of course there is better metrics gathering solution like TICK stack and so on but if you already have Sensu client deploy on your infrastructure and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to install another software like Collectd, Filebeat or Telegraf in order to send metrics into Graphana, InfluxDB or ElasticSearch.</description>

Each time we create a virtual machine, we need to connect with Spice in order to get the private IP or use tool like nmap or check the ARP cache.</description>

draft: false What is virtualization ? Since the 1960s and mainframe computers, computer scientists have made huge progress on virtualization. However until late 1990s, this was out of fashion. Popek and Goldberg defined it as &amp;ldquo;an efficient and isolated duplicate of a real machine&amp;rdquo;. Nowadays, even if some are still reluctant to the idea, virtual machines are present everywhere in the IT world.</description>
